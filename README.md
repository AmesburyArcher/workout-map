This is a project that has evolved from a simple mapping app that only supported adding workouts. That early stage of the project was worked on collaboratively with Jonas through his teachings. Jonas provided the HTML skeleton, basic CSS, and aided in the basic JavaScript functionality. As I have continued learning and developing, I have added numerous new features to the application which have been worked on solely by my self. Such features include:

1. Editing workouts
2. Deleting workouts
3. Rebuilding the workout objects which were stored in local storage
4. The ability to sort workouts by distance, and being able to go back to the original order
5. Form validation

I will be continously adding to this project as I develop my skills more and more.
